Revision 1.69  2006/12/10 20:03:57  bartoldu

Resurrect the old BtoXGammaFilter under the name of the clone used on
the BtoRhoGammaPath, and substitute an instance of that filter for the
clone.  This restores the behavior of the BtoRhoGamma skims while
decoupling them from BtoXGamma.

Revision 1.68  2006/10/23 20:59:49  bartoldu

Changes to BtoXGamma{Filter.cc/Path.tcl}:
- Move utility class for counting cut efficiencies into
  RecoUtils/FltCounter.hh.
- Move the BGFMultiHadron cut from tcl (clone) into this filter so it
  can be accounted for in the tally.

Revision 1.67  2006/10/18 23:04:50  bartoldu

- Re-implemented the BtoXGammaSkim to perform the cuts that are
  actually used in the fully inclusive b->s gamma analysis.  The
  previous version would accept BGFMultiHadron or BGFNeutralHadron
  events and do an e1Mag cut.  The present version requires
  BGFMultiHadron and performs the cuts described in BAD1491:
  nGoodTracksLoose >= 3, one photon on GoodPhotonLoose with 1.5 <=
  Egamma < 3.5 and -0.74 <= cosThetaGamma < 0.93, r2All < 0.7,
  pTrackMax < 2.5.

Revision 1.66  2006/02/02 18:32:13  kelsey
Wups.  Per GPDF, tag V00-19-00 due to data member name change.

Revision 1.61  2005/04/11 04:07:55  edward
XSLBtoXulnuFilter: 1. Add separate cosBY cuts for gamma mode.  2. Check for brem recovery overlaps with the lepton and the hadron (or photon).  3.  Add isBGFNeutralHadron to the check, OR'ed with isBGFMH
