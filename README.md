** SOFTWARE USED FOR PHD THESIS PROJECTS**

*Measurement of the decay rates: Ds --> l + neutrino  ( l = electron, muon, tau)*

-`DRecoilToolsUser`, `workdir_DsBranchingFractions`:
  - Modules run on the BaBar framework 
  - Reconstruct the entire collission event information
  - Applies data reduction
  - Applies the data models and fits

*Search for D (c-u, c-d) mesons in excited states*

-`workdir_DstarAnalysis`
  - Configuration of the BaBar framework
  - Runs the event reconstruction and selection
  - Applies the data models and fits

*Misc Tools*
-`scripts`: 
  - controlling batch jobs
  - library of data models
  - histogram tools
  - Parallel computing tests
