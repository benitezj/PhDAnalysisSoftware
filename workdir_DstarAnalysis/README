THE WORKDIR PACKAGE             Mod history at bottom
-------------------

Workdir is a package from which you can run BaBar executables in a simple 
way. Input and output are local to the workdir directory, and the 
whole directory tree can be moved out of the release directory tree 
you obtained it in and into a stable, personal working area, eg. ~/workdir, 
where it can thereafter be used with a user-selectable release directory. 
The RELEASE link points to the selected directory. This way you can work 
in a stable environment and switch between releases as you please.

Problems, comments, questions to the PC of the package.

Setup:
------

  addpkg workdir
  cd workdir
  gmake setup   (to use workdir with the current release directory = ../) OR
  gmake setup RELDIR=<release directory>
                (see 'gmake help' for gmake options)

Help:
-----

  README file
  'gmake help'
  'betarun help'
  
Running root:  (from within workdir)

-------------

  bbrroot

    This script (installed in bin/$BFARCH from the RooUtils package)
    uses the version of ROOT used to build release, and ignores
    the value of the ROOTSYS environment variable (if any was set).

    During startup from workdir, ROOT will read the .rootrc file
    which configures the macro and shared library paths to look for
    files in the current test and production releases (in that order).
    It will also process the RooAlias.C and RooLogon.C files to initialize
    a standardized ROOT session for working within a BaBar release.

    Edit RooLogon.C in your workdir to customize which BaBar libraries
    you want to use (see the comments for details). None are loaded
    by default. Note that ROOT shared libraries are not currently built in
    a production release so you must now check out each package you want
    to use and build its library with "gmake <pkg>.rootlib ROPT=-Shared".

    Use the "BABAR" style and the BABARLabel() or BABARSmartLabel() 
    functions to create BaBar approved plots:

      gROOT->SetStyle("BABAR");
      ...
      BABARLabel();  -- or --  BABARSmartLabel();

Running other executables:
--------------------------

  'gmake setup' generates a link bin->RELEASE/bin so that executables you
  have generated in your release directory pointed to by RELEASE are on
  the standard SRT path.

Migrating workdir to a stable personal work area
------------------------------------------------

  gmake migrate TODIR=dirname
     eg. 'gmake migrate TODIR=~/workdir' will move the tree to ~/workdir.

Files, directories, links in workdir
------------------------------------

  GNUmakefile   makefile to manage links (eg. to the release directory),
                migrate workdir to a stable private area, etc.

  RELEASE       link to the release directory of choice. Defaults to ../
                Is set by 'gmake setup [RELDIR=dir]'

  kumac         directory of useful kumac macros

Modification history
--------------------
28 Feb 2005 M. Kelsey
- Fix "clean" target in GNUmakefile to remove all official symlinks.

09 Dec 2004 M. Kelsey (note added here 28 Feb 2005)
- Add kumac/bbrpath.kumac to implement BaBar path searching in PAW.

13 Oct 2004 M. Kelsey
- Add dummy "allbin" target to GNUmakefile to suppress spurious error.

2 Sep 2003 Stephen J. Gowdy
- Update migrate target so that it does not copy the CVS directory
- Update migrate target so that it uses gtar instead of tar

26 Mar 2002 Peter Elmer
- Removed betaScript.tcl (I think this is obsolete, it is still in CVS
  if somebody wants it)
- Moved 'betarun' to BetaUser (and added it to BINSCRIPTS there)

8 Feb 2002 David Norvil Brown
- Removed soft link to GraDisplay setup by gmake setup.  Removed disprun 
  script (moved to GraDisplay package).

8 Feb 2002 Peter Elmer
- Cleaned out obsolete bbsim flotsam and jetsam, cleaned up README a bit

23 Apr 2001  Eric Charles
- added BtaCutTools to betaLoad() macro

23 Apr 2001  Eric Charles
- added BetaMicroTruth to betaLoad() macro

06 Apr 2001  Eric Charles

justification; added more online help.

2000/12/07  Alexandre (Sasha) Telnov

Unlike BABARLabel(), which was kept unchanged to avoid breaking existing
macros, BABARSmartLabel() produces consistenly good results no matter what 
the ratio the pad's sides is.

    and to ensure that the same result is obtained wen running in workdir
    we have out this file here. prod.db should succed runtime.db but
    right now both are needed.
    Similar for prod.ffr, this contains the ffread cards for running bbsim,
    it will replace sample.cards, but both are needed at the moment.
