  can be different.)

V00-02-05

V00-01-03
- add () etc, to make compiler (release 15.5.0) not give warnings.

V00-01-02
- Turns out it doesn't need iostream anyway. Remove #include <iostream>,
  using std::cout;   , etc. Should be still compatible with pre-iostream
  releases.

V00-01-01
- Rename "PidMap" to "BitMap"; it deals with any bitmap associated with 
  charged tracks, including "TracksMap", which contains track quality such as 
  "GoodTracksLoose", etc.
- BtuCandBlock:  add POCA info.
                 add PIDWeight  (needs BetaPid V00-01-88, CdbBdb V00-08-02
                                 and EffTable V00-00-08, or better)

                  add "ntupleName" command to specify ntuple name
                  add "writeEveryEvent" command to control whether or not
                      to write out events with no candidates. Default is true.
- BtuCandBlock: add "Doca" and "DocaXY"
- BtuGamContentEMC: add E_raw, A42 and nCrystals.

V00-00-03  (chcheng, 2004-07-19)

  (e.g., brem-recovered e -> e gamma).
